# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a software project. It documents and structures the foundational requirements needed for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing requirements for a software system. It involves understanding the needs of stakeholders and translating them into a clear set of functional and non-functional requirements. This process is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for all subsequent phases, including design, development, and testing.
