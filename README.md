# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a software project. It documents and structures the foundational requirements needed for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing requirements for a software system. It involves understanding the needs of stakeholders and translating them into a clear set of functional and non-functional requirements. This process is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for all subsequent phases, including design, development, and testing.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis is critical for several reasons:
-   **Prevents Scope Creep:** By clearly defining the project's boundaries, it helps avoid unnecessary features being added later, which can lead to delays and budget overruns.
-   **Reduces Project Failure:** A strong understanding of requirements minimizes misunderstandings between stakeholders and the development team, leading to a higher chance of delivering a successful product.
-   **Improves Communication:** It serves as a common language for all parties involved, ensuring everyone is aligned on what needs to be built.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

-   **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting and capturing all the needs and expectations from stakeholders.
-   **Requirement Elicitation:** Drawing out and understanding the requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
-   **Requirement Documentation:** Writing down the collected requirements in a clear, structured, and unambiguous manner.
-   **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Examining the requirements for consistency and feasibility, and creating visual models (like diagrams) to represent them.
-   **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors or functions of a system. They define what the system must do.
-   **Examples for a Booking System:**
    -   The system must allow a user to search for available properties.
    -   The system must allow a user to book a property by selecting a date range.
    -   The system must process payments securely for a booking.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system should behave. They define qualities or attributes of the system, such as performance, security, and usability.
-   **Examples for a Booking System:**
    -   The website must load within 3 seconds on a standard internet connection.
    -   User data must be encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
    -   The system must be able to handle 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
